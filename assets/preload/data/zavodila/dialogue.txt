:dad:You've pushed quite a lot of buttons while I was away, huh?
:dad:Well you really should've just ran away or joined the church while you could.
:dad:But you decided to pull a struggle. So here we are.
:dad:Name's Ruv by the way. But that is the last name you will probably be hearing after this.
:dad:I would be too tired to do these kind of stuff, but...
:dad:...I have to do what I'm meant to do.
:dad:I'd say break a leg but I might end up breaking yours literally and I'm going to make this as painful as possible for you...
:dad:...and your little girlfriend.
:bf:!!!
